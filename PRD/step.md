I want to implement the user management feature by integrating the frontend admin dashboard @admin focus on the User management tab with the backend smart contract using the abis @abi. I want to be able to grant a user address a role (based on what is selected, admin, game, and mint). use ethersjs to interact with the blockchain, create a config file for all the constants such as contract deployed address, etc, use env.local file to access other sensitive info @.env.local . Ensure that errors are handled properly. Use the correct data type and handle api request properly as well as client requests. Retain the UI design. The deployed addresses can be found here @deployer.md
let me know if you need anything else
