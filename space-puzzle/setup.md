To run and test the puzzle game implementation from scratch in a new Python environment, you'll need to set up the environment, install the required dependencies, create the necessary files, and organize the project structure. Here's a comprehensive guide:

```python
pygame==2.5.2

```

For a complete setup, you'll need to:

1. Create a new project directory
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Install the requirements
4. Create the game files
5. Create/download necessary media assets

Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Create Project Structure

```
space-puzzle/
├── requirements.txt    # Package dependencies
├── game.py            # Main game code
└── media/             # Directory for game assets
    ├── bg.png         # Background image
    ├── spaceship.png  # Player spaceship
    ├── alien1.png     # Asteroid (repurposed)
    ├── alien3.png     # Portal (repurposed)
    ├── alien4.png     # Barrier (repurposed)
    ├── alien_bullet.png # Key (repurposed)
    ├── explosion.wav  # Error sound
    ├── explosion2.wav # Complete sound
    └── laser.wav      # Collect sound
```

### 2. Set Up Environment and Install Requirements

On Windows:

```bash
# Create project directory and navigate to it
mkdir space-puzzle
cd space-puzzle

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Create requirements.txt file with the content from above
# Then install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
# Create project directory and navigate to it
mkdir space-puzzle
cd space-puzzle

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Create requirements.txt file with the content from above
# Then install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Game

```bash
python game.py
```

### Controls:

- Arrow keys to move the spaceship
- Collect all keys to activate the portal
- Reach the portal to advance to the next level
