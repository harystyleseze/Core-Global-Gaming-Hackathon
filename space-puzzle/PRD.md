Core Puzzle Mechanics:

Grid-based Movement: The player moves on a grid rather than freely, making each move a strategic decision.
Key Collection: Players must collect a certain number of keys before they can progress.
Obstacle Avoidance: Asteroids (repurposed aliens) block paths and require planning to navigate around.
Barriers: Special obstacles that require spending a collected key to remove.
Portal Activation: The exit portal only activates once all keys are collected, forcing players to explore the entire level.

Additional Puzzle Elements You Could Add:

Color-coded Keys and Doors: Have keys that only open matching colored barriers.
Teleporters: Create paired teleporters that transport the player across the board.
Pushable Asteroids: Allow players to push some asteroids to create pathways.
Energy Management: Give the ship limited energy, making each movement a resource to manage.
Memory Puzzles: Show the solution path briefly before starting, requiring the player to memorize it.
Timed Elements: Add doors that open and close on a schedule, requiring precise timing.
Pattern Recognition: Create puzzles where players must follow specific movement patterns.
Puzzle Clues: Add visual clues in the background that hint at the solution.
