# Space Puzzle - Game Guide

## Basic Controls

- Use the **Arrow Keys** to move your spaceship:
  - ↑ (Up Arrow): Move up
  - ↓ (Down Arrow): Move down
  - ← (Left Arrow): Move left
  - → (Right Arrow): Move right

## Game Elements

### Your Spaceship

- You control a spaceship that moves on a grid
- Starting position is always on the left side of the screen
- Can only move one square at a time
- Cannot move diagonally

### Goal

- Reach the portal on the right side of the screen
- The portal is initially inactive (appears dimmed)
- You must collect all keys before the portal activates
- Once the portal is active, move your spaceship into it to complete the level

### Keys and Barriers

- **Keys**: Small collectible items in different colors:
  - Red
  - Green
  - Blue
  - Yellow
- **Barriers**: Colored blocks that match the keys
  - Each barrier can only be removed by a key of the same color
  - Once you use a key on a matching barrier, both disappear
  - You cannot pass through a barrier without the matching key

### Obstacles

- **Asteroids**: Immovable obstacles that block your path
  - Cannot be removed
  - Must be navigated around
  - Appear as alien-like objects

### Teleporters (Advanced Levels)

- Appear from Level 3 onwards
- Come in pairs with matching colors:
  - Cyan (light blue) pairs
  - Magenta (pink) pairs
- Moving onto a teleporter instantly transports you to its paired location
- Useful for quick navigation around obstacles

## Scoring System

- Score increases by 100 × current level when completing a level
- Higher levels offer more points
- Score is displayed in the top-left corner

## Strategy Tips

### DO's:

1. **Plan Your Route**

   - Look at the entire level before moving
   - Identify key locations and barriers
   - Plan which keys to collect first

2. **Use Teleporters Wisely**

   - Teleporters can help you avoid long detours
   - Use them to escape dead ends
   - Remember their locations for backtracking

3. **Prioritize Keys**
   - Collect keys that unlock critical paths first
   - Keep track of which colored barriers you need to remove

### DON'Ts:

1. **Don't Get Trapped**

   - Avoid moving into corners without an escape route
   - Watch out for asteroid formations that might block your path

2. **Don't Waste Keys**

   - Only use keys on barriers that are blocking your necessary path
   - Some barriers might not need to be removed to complete the level

3. **Don't Rush**
   - Take your time to analyze the level
   - Each move should be purposeful
